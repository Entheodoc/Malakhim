This project is an operational dashboard designed to increase the effectiveness, accountability and sustainability of a medication adherence program for older adults.

SECTION 1 - Medication Adherence Program Overview and Strategic Goals
The design of the program is guided by five program goals. Each goal is grounded in findings from the medication adherence and health services literature. Throughout de development process, these goals serve as a recursive design checklist: every metric, visualization and workflow step should be geared to advance at least one of them.
 

# 1-Empower older adults to make informed decisions about their health. 
We aim to empower older dults to make informed decisions and take an active role in managing their health, with a focus on chornic conditions and prescribed medications.

Low health literacy is common among older adults and is consistely associated with poorer medications adherence and worse health outcomes.[1,2] Interventions that improve halth literacy, such as tailored communication, medication counseling, and simplified educational materials have been shown to support safer medication use and better adherence in this population. 

How this goal informs the dashboard design.

-Materials provided to the patients are explicitly tied to dashboard indicators.

-Visualizations are desined so that complex clinical information can be translated into simple, actionable talking points during patient encounters.

-The dashboard will help monitor the specifc actions directed to increase health literacy and provide clear insights into the most effective among those actions.


# 2-Increasing older adults access to their prescribed medications.
We seek to improve older adult's access to their prescribed medications by activeliy detecting and minimizing barriers to adherence and reducing the practical distance between the patients and their medications. 

In older adults, medication nonadherence is driven not only by cost, but also by logistical and practical barriers such as transportation, pharmacy access, polypharmacy, regimen complexity, and fragmentation of care.[3.4] These barriers are especially relevant for patients with mobility limitations, low income and limited social support.

How this informs the dashboard design.

-The dashboard highlights logistical risk factors (e.g. Multiple pharmacies, long gaps between fills, missed delivery attempts).

-The design intentionaly supports workflows aimed at reducing physical distance between the older adults and their medications, such as: 
   -synchronization of refills,
   -home delivery or mail order,
   -blister packs or pill organizers,
   -caregiver, case manager, and family involvement,
   -facilitation of technologic solutions such as telemedicine.

-Operational metrics are intended to allow the team to monitor how well access barriers are being addressed overt time. (e.g., "time from gap occurrence to identification", "percentage of patients converted to a larger prscription days supply, delivery or synchronization").
   



# 3-Achieving measurable improvement in patient health outcomes. 
We strive to achieve measurable improvement in patient health outcomes by providing access to clear, actionalble health data and consistently tracking progress over time. 

Robust evidence shows that better medication adherence is associated with improved clinical outcomes across multiple chronic diseases and reduced hospitalizations and mortality.[5.6] Systematic reviews also demonstrate that interventions focused in adherence can lead to both, clinical and economical benefist at the population level.[5]

How this goal informs the dashboard design:

-Core key performance indicators (KPIs) include both, process measures and outcome-related proxies.

-The dashboard emphasizes trend monitoring so that changes in adherence patters can be detected and acted on early.

-Where possible, the structure is future-proofed to incorporate clinical endpoints. (e.g., hospitalizations, emergency department visits, A1c test results,blood pressure readings)
This is achieved by actively minimizing the effect of barriers to adherence and reducing the physical distance betweeen the medication and the patient. 


by providing access to clear, actionable health data and consistently monitoring progress over time.




4-Fostering a healthy, respectuful and supportive work environment for all team-members. 



by prioritizing their well-being and reducing burnout. 



5-Ensuring that the program and its goals are financially sustainable by minimizing halthcare waste, optimizing resources allocation and striving for continuous, measurable improvement.
